            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Epiſtle.</note>The firſt is the Epiſtle, the putting of this peece in the Maſſe is aſcribed to Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Damaſus,</hi> ſo <hi>Gemma Animae. cap.</hi> 88. <hi>[Epiſtolam &amp; Evangelium Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Papa ad Miſſam legi inſtituit, Hieronymus autem Presbyter Lectionarium, &amp; Evangeliarium, ut hodiè habet Eccleſia, collegit, ſed Damaſus Papa, ut nunc moris eſt, legi cenſuit:]</hi> but who ever have put the Epiſtle in the Maſſe it ſeemes incredible, that the abuſes of the Epiſtle, which this day are in the Maſſe, and in our Booke from it, can have any very ancient, or yet very judicious authour. Why againſt the order of the New Teſtament are the Epiſtles ſet before the Goſpel, the reaſon which the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts give, is that the Epiſtles are baſer then the Goſpel, <hi>Alcuin</hi> indeed denies this, but <hi>Walafridus</hi> and the reſt after him avow it: alſo becauſe that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle hath the office of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, making way for the Goſpel of Chriſt, they containe morall inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are but like to the Law, and ſo their doctrine is of leſſe worth then the doctrine of the Goſpel: the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle is read by a Subdeacon in a lower place, the people
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:156872:17"/> ſitting; but the Goſpel muſt bee read at leaſt by a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con in a high place all reverently ſtanding, ſee <hi>Innoc. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 29. <hi>Durand, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 53. I cite but one paſſage of <hi>Rupertus de divinis officijs. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 32. <hi>[Epiſtola vox legis eſt ſuam in Joanne imperfectionem profitentis, &amp; ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem Evangelicam ſuos auditores tranſmittentis. Quam vis autem ſaepè de Apoſtolicis ſumatur literis, tamen in eo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du eſt, ac ſi ſemper de lege ſit ac Prophetis, ſemper enim mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitatem vitámque activam magis quàm contemplativae ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitatem, quae in Evangelio radiat, inſtruit.

            </p>
            <p>Another evident abuſe there is, that in the Maſſe and our Booke, the Acts of the Apoſtles, the Revelation, the Prophets, any booke of the old Teſtament ſhould bee called the Epiſtle except onely the five bookes of <hi>Moſes. Walafridus</hi> points at the noveltie of this corruption in theſe words, <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>[Videtur autem non alias lectiones an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Evangelium fuiſſe tunc poſitas, niſi tantùm Apostoli Pauli quod S.

            <p>A third abuſe in the Epiſtle is, that never a full paſſage is read but a ſhread, beginning after the beginning of a Chapter, and cutting before the end, chuſing out parts moſt impertinent for the purpoſe, and very oft directed to colour ſome idle or ſuperſtitious conceit: To theſe and other ſuch faults, the Epiſtles of our booke are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as well as theſe of the Maſſe; for commonly in both bookes, the ſame paſſages of Scripture are ſet downe for Epiſtles, as on S. <hi>Stephens</hi> day the ſeventh of the <hi>Acts,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond is the Goſpel.</note>The next portion of the inſtruction is the Goſpel, here we follow the paterne of <hi>Sarum</hi> as much as in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as the <hi>Miſſals</hi> reade the Goſpels without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that which the ſole pleaſure of ſome Popes in the latter times hath given to them, beginning at the end of a booke, at the midſt of a Chapter, ending with the beginning of a booke, looping every day heere and there without any reaſon or example of antiquity which can be ſhowne, ſo does our Booke follow preciſelie, looke for example the firſt foure Sundayes in <hi>Advent,</hi> wherein the firſt Sunday our Goſpel is <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 1. in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, chap. 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. in the 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. in the 4. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. of ſuch courſing what reaſon can be given, but a conformity with <hi>Sarum</hi> in times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
            <p>As in the matter of our Goſpel we follow rhe <hi>Miſſall</hi> ſo in our formes.

            <p>The Booke of the Goſpel muſt ſtand upon the Altar to ſignifie that with the preaching of the Goſpel ever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156872:18"/> muſt be conjoyned the ſacrifice of the Altar, and when it is to be read, the Deacon muſt come, and lift the booke from the Altar, to ſignifie that the ſenſe of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt be taken alone from the warrant of the holy Church, ſee <hi>Heigam. pag.</hi> 122. In the ceremonies and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications it ſeemes we muſt agree with Rome, for wee ſee that among the decent furniture wherewith our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is adorned, the text of the Goſpel is a chiefe part, alſo the neceſſity of the Altars and ſacrifices, where ever the Goſpel is preached, and the taking of the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the hand of the Church, yee may ſee expreſſe paſſages from <hi>Heylen, Montagu,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>-ſelfe-conviction.</p>
            <p>Farther, when the Deacon hath lifted the text of the Goſpel from the Altar, hee gives it to the Subdeacon to carry at his backe, two waxe candles are lifted from the Altar by two Acolytes, to bee carried burning before him ſo long as the Goſpel is in reading, the croſſe or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix is alſo on Feſtivall dayes carried before the Goſpel, alſo a Cenſer with fire and Incenſe, the booke is croſſed, and perfumed, and when the leſſon is ended, the Booke by the Deacon is kiſſed, the reaſon of all theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſee in the forenamed places of <hi>Durand</hi> and <hi>Jnnocent,</hi> from none of theſe ſuperſtitions we can be long ſecured: Our Deacons are begun already to bee conſecrate, the chiefe part of their office is their Service at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their reading of Scripture; the orders of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon and Acolytes are proclaimed to be convenient, if the Church had maintenance for them, by <hi>Andrewes:</hi> the wax Candles are ſtanding on the Altars already: the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Crucifix is avowed by <hi>Pocklington</hi> to have a meet ſtanding upon the ſame Altar; the croſſings and perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings and lights are maintained by <hi>Andrewes,</hi> as <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> ſets him forth, the kiſſing of the Booke is now daily practiſed.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156872:22"/> our Book ſeemes to goe beyond the <hi>Miſſall</hi> in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in three reſpects; firſt, in the needleſſe multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of paſſages to the number of ſixteene, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the poſterior Rubrick the ſaying not onely one of them, but of them all, whereas the <hi>Miſſall</hi> eſchewing here tediouſneſſe, beſide its cuſtome, is content with one paſſage alone, as <hi>Durand</hi> remarks, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 62. Secondly, the paſſages of the <hi>Miſſall</hi> doe no wayes ſavour, for the farre moſt part of a Legall, Jewiſh, or any proper Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither does the Engliſh paſſages looke that way, but the paſſages which our Book here doth uſe, as may be ſeene in the firſt five, ſet in the forefront, all out of the old Teſtament, carries directly to a legall oblation. Thirdly, how ever the avarice of the Romiſh Clergy be notorious, and their purpoſe in this part of the Maſſe to draw money from the people to their owne purſes be well knowne, yet they are not ſo impudent as to make a profeſſion in their Booke of ſuch a baſe deſigne, but our men think no ſhame to avow their deſigne, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervert the peoples oblations, and to ſpoyle the poore of their almes, for all the Scriptures which are ſaid for the Offertory, where one is for an almes to the poore, three are expreſly directed for a gift to the Church and the Prieſt, however ſome of the ſame Scriptures be uſed in the Engliſh, yet all their Rubricks hinder this abuſe and miſapplication, and doe not permit the Clergie to take up for themſelves what was given onely for the poore, but our Rubrick is expreſſe for the giving of the one half to the Presbyter, and the other half to any pious or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable uſe that the Prieſt thinks meeteſt, the Church fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, or what elſe, though the poore ſhould ſterve.</p>

            <p>THe impoſing of the Books on the Biſhops part is an act of greater tyranny, than ever was uſed in this Nation; for ſome few men by a Letter purchaſed from a Prince to preſſe on a Nation againſt the hearts of all ranks and eſtates, contrary to many Lawes of this Church and Kingdome, ſtanding both in force and practice, three or foure Books full of novations, all to be beleeved in every poynt, by every perſon, under paine of the great Excommunication, doth caſt our ſoules, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and eſtates under a ſlavery intolerable. In <hi>England,</hi> yea in <hi>Ireland</hi> to this day, as our adverſaries confeſſe, the ſmalleſt rite was never enjoyned without the conſent of a Convocation or generall Aſſembly. By this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the Maſſe, yea the Alcoran or Talmud will not be gotten refuſed; let all the Kingdome cry they are againſt Scripture and the Lawes of Church and State, they ſhall not be heard, if ſo ſome two or three prime and leading Biſhops will oppoſe: no barre had been left us againſt the Alcoran, let be the Maſſe-book, but the ſole will of our gracious Prince, if ſo this practice of our Biſhops had gone on.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:156872:51"/>
            <p>Secondly, The ſervice Book is all for common word by word drawne out of Popiſh Ritualls, which this day are uſed at Rome. The firſt part of it is a compend of the Mattins and Veſpers in the Breviarie: The ſecond is, the ſumme of the <hi>Miſſall,</hi> the third of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Maſſe Book, which all Proteſtants of whatever name doe ſo farre abhorre that they rather would die than imbrace it, this abhominable Maſſe hath three parts; The Ordinary, which is ſung on any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon day; The Temporall, which is additions or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges uſed in all Sundayes and high Feſtivals: The San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorall, which is the formes added to the ordinary Maſſe on the Saints dayes. Theſe three parts of the Maſſe are all ſet downe in our Booke; Out of the temporall wee have above foureſcore formes, out of the Sanctorall, about twentie, what we leave out which the Maſſe hath, may be taken in upon the ſame reaſons whereupon wee take what wee have borrowed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The ordinary Maſſe is commonly divided in ſix parts; The Preparation, The Inſtruction, The Offertory, The Canon, The Communion, The Poſt Communion: Our Booke hath all theſe ſix in order.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The Preparation is ſubdivided in twelve por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof we have ten neere word by word, the Pater noſter, the Collect, the Gloria Patri, the Cyrie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyſon, the Confeſſion, the Miſereatur, the Abſolution, the Angelike Hymne, the Salutation, the Oremus. The two which remaines, <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and the <hi>Introibo ad altare,</hi> we may not refuſe upon reaſon. <hi>Stafford</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to print that it is puritaniſme to refuſe to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Marie</hi> theſe <hi>haile Maries</hi> which our forbeares of old wont to ſing to her; for the <hi>Introibo</hi> our prime Biſhops avow, that our Booke not onely hath an <hi>Introibo ad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,</hi> but which is much worſe <hi>Adoremus altare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, The Inſtruction hath eight portions, foure principall, which we have all in the ſame order, foure of little moment, to wit, the Graduall, Halelujah, <hi>Tractus,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:156872:51"/> and <hi>Sequentia.</hi> Theſe with the Popes good leave may all be omitted, as <hi>Spalato</hi> ſhews at large, and if the Pope will not diſpence therewith, we might not refuſe them on any reaſon according to our Bookmens grounds.</p>
            <p>The principall are the Epiſtles, Goſpells, Creed, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. In the reading of the Epiſtles and Goſpels, we follow punctually the miſorders, the follies, the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Papiſts, we caſt the Epiſtles ever before and the Goſpels behind, contrary to the order of Scripture, we begin at the end of one chapter and end at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of another, we courſe from place to place without any reaſon oft imaginable except the free-will of ſome fooliſh Pope, who cut Scripture in patches, and coucht it in the <hi>Miſſall</hi> as his fancy led him: or ſome ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceit of the day whereto he would apply ſuch Scriptures, but oft with an evident impertinency. The Acts, the Revelation, the Bookes of the Prophets, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Pentateuch we call them all Epiſtles even as the Maſſe. We are commanded to ſtand at the Goſpells and ſay at their beginning and ending the Popiſh ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but at the Epiſtles wee may ſit and keepe ſilence; of this ſoule ſuperſtition there can be no reaſon given, but that wicked errour of the Papiſts, that the doctrine of the Epiſtles is more baſe and contemptible than the doctrine of the Evangeliſts, and ſo ſhould be before it as a ſervant goes before to make way for his Maſter. This wicked ſuperſtition they much increaſe, when they command to ſtand alſo at the reading of the Creed of Conſtantinople; by this meanes equalling an humane writ to the Goſpels, and preferring it much to the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, at reading whereof they permit to ſit.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, the Predication is urged in the old <hi>Miſſals,</hi> but in the late order of <hi>Sarum</hi> it is omitted, this we follow and permit Communions to be celebrated without any Preaching, a horrible evill, who diſpence with Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Communion day, may well want it all the dayes of the yeare, wee are here worſe than the Papiſts, the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> urges Biſhops to preach every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:156872:52"/> and many moe dayes, our folks cry downe preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo farre as they can, and profeſſe that it were good to have no more preaching then there was before the 18. yeare of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eight; They teach that many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould be kept in their place, but commanded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to preach ſo long as they live, that ſome few who are ſuffered to preach ſhould doe it but at ſome rare times, once in the moneth is abundant; that the reading of the Service is the onely ordinary Preaching that God hath commanded, that by this means people may be brought back to that old ſimplicitie, and ſo that ancient honeſtie which was among our fore-fathers before <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> was borne.</p>
            <p>Yet there is more ill in this part of our Book, Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are to be framed by our Prelates, and what ever is put in them we muſt beleeve under the paine of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. The Homilies of the Breviarie are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the moſt part by the old Fathers, theſe of <hi>England</hi> by the Martyrs of that Church whoſe writes are very orthodox, but our Homilies are to be made by men whoſe lives are not approved, and whoſe doctrine is knowne to be both Arminian and Popiſh, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but ſuch ſtuffe as they have vented in many Sermons will be put in our Homilies, which notwithſtanding we muſt without doubt ſimply beleeve, unleſſe we would be excommunicate.</p>
            <p>Eightly, The Offertory, a plaine Jewiſh oblation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before and making way for the unbloudy and propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory ſacrifice, we have clearly. In the Maſſe it hath foure parts, ſo in our Book; the firſt is Scriptures ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the people to offer; the ſecond, an Oblation of moneys; the third, an oblation of bread and wine; the fourth, prayers upon the bread and wine to prepare it for the enſuing ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>In the firſt we goe beyond the Papiſts, they content themſelves with one place of Scripture, we have fifteene or moe: many of them pointing at the Jewiſh ſacrifice, yea directed to countenance the Prieſts greid. Our Book
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:156872:52"/> here patronizes that vile ſacriledge of the Maſſe-Prieſt, who ſayes his Maſſe for advantage, for we are permitted to take to our owne uſe the one halfe of the offering, and to employ the other halfe in what good uſe the Prieſt and the Church-warden can agree. In the ſecond part we have a plaine legall ſacrifice, a putting of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered money in the Prieſts hand, who ſets it on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar before the Lord. In the third place, we have an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of bread and wine on the Table. In the fourth part likewiſe prayers over the bread &amp; wine that God would accept them for the benefit of the whole Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, both dead and living; the Maſſe expreſſes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſome dead mens names, which our men doe not inſert but keep them in the generall.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, The Canon which the Papiſts call the heart and head of their Maſſe, <hi>cor &amp; vertex,</hi> conſiſts of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces and Prayers. Their prefaces are either ordinarie, or ſolemne: the ordinary we have word by word; the ſolemne are ten for high times; the firſt five for Chriſt-maſſe, Paſce, Pentecoſt, Aſcenſion, Trinitie, we have: The other five we want, but upon no neceſſitie. The prayers are ſix in number, the third and fourth they count the onely principall, to wit, the prayer of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and the prayer of oblation; theſe two we have avowedly. The Papiſts diſtinguiſh their conſecration from ſanctification; conſecration, eſpecially here, they call a ſecret pronouncing of ſome holy words on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their tranſubſtantiation, we avow ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret murmuring of words on the elements, for this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of conſecration is not ſaid that the people may heare, but in it we are ordained to run from them ſo far as the outmoſt wall will ſuffer, and then we muſt come to the weſt ſide of the Altar, and ſo turne our back, we muſt be within both the raile of timber and vaile of cloth, leaſt men ſhould either ſee or heare us ſo we may uſe any language we will, for God underſtands all, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments none. That the ſecret prayers over the elements are made for their converſion into the body and blood
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:156872:53"/> of Chriſt it is cleare, for we take in theſe words of the Maſſe, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat corpus &amp; ſanguis,</hi> whence all Papiſts this day conclude tranſubſtantiation, and which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> put out of their Booke for feare to further by them this hereſie; we put out the clauſe which ſtood here in the old Miſſals, <hi>Quod eſt figura corporis &amp; ſanguinis,</hi> which did oppoſe this wicked hereſie, yea ſome two or three gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den paſſages of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgie which did oppoſe likewiſe that abhomination we ſcrape out. And to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us more of their minde they have put in ſome new Rubricks, to eat the remains by Communicants in the holy place, to conſecrate ſo little as can be, and to cover all with a Corporall, which word was never here uſed before the <hi>corpus</hi> was beleeved to be under the elements, all this our Book hath gotten, as is averred, <hi>propter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentarios;</hi> ſuch hereticks muſt we be who beleeve the body of Chriſt to be conteined in the heavens untill he come againe. They tell us that Papiſts, Lutherans, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts are fully agreed on all that is materiall in that queſtion, to wit, Chriſts reall preſence, that the onely difference is about the mode and manner of preſence, which is but an unneceſſary, curious, and undecidable queſtion, about the which none will contend, did not the Devill foſter up Puritans and Jeſuits to hold in that fire, yea they are now come to avow the Popiſh mode, to proclaime the body of Chriſt to be received by our bodies and that corporally, and to be upon the Altar ſo groſſely, that the Altar as its chaire of eſtate is to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>latria</hi> it ſelfe, for the bodies preſence on it, yea that the Papiſts when they worſhip the Altar or the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or the ſpecies that are about the body, are in no caſe Idolaters for that action: yea that the Church of Rome doth maintaine no kinde of Idolatry. The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks of this part of the Maſſe ſome we take, as the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hands on the patin and challice. The Rubrick of bowing before the patin and challice or hoſtie, thereof we have not a word but punctually our men practice it, giving foure inclinaboes to the elements before the act
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:156872:53"/> of receiving: the other Rubrick for the peoples proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the elevation of the hoſty they cannot be againſt, ſure their practice is to bow moſt lowly to the place where the hoſtie uſes to lye.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, The prayer of Oblation ſtands at the back of the conſecration in the Maſſe, and ſo in our Book, there is in the words ſome changes, but what we adde or detract it is for our diſadvantage, the maine words whereon the unbloudy ſacrifice is grounded we have, and if what we want of it were added, we muſt not refuſe it, for they defend all this part of the Maſſe, making no bones to profeſſe the offering up of Chriſts body and blood in a propitiatory ſacrifice for the benefit both of quick and dead, yea in this matter of a true externall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody ſacrifice, which the Prieſts in the new Teſtament ordained by Chriſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> in theſe words <hi>hoc facite,</hi> doe offer: our men within theſe two yeares have gone very neere as far as any of the Romiſh Writers.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, The other foure particles of the Canon we omit, but needleſly, for our men defend them all as good and lawfull for the matter, the things moſt to be ſtood upon are that in them the Pope is prayed for as the chiefe Biſhop: this now theſe with whom we have to doe will eaſily digeſt, to count him Antichriſt is but the malicious ignorance of Puritanes, yea it is but their mad frenſie to deny him this day the ſtyle of holineſſe in the very abſtract, he is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, that order requires one to be chiefe and firſt among all Biſhops, this honour is due to him who ſits in <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, that injurie was done unto him in the reformation, in taking from him not onely his uſurped power but even his proper right. In theſe prayers alſo the B. of the dioceſſe is put before the King; this now is not ſtrange to the faction, they print that every B. is a true Prince, yea a Monarch, ſo much more excellent than a King as the ſoule is more excellent than the bodie, that the Emperours in dutie ought to light downe from their horſe and give reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:156872:54"/> to the Biſhops, yea on their knees to receive their bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, The third ſcruple that might deterre us from theſe prayers, is that the names of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and of many Saints are reckoned up, by whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions and merits we pray to be defended this alſo they defend; in their prefaces to their prayers, they delight to reckon up the names of theſe Saints, they maintaine the Saints to be our Mediatours of interceſſion, as Chriſt is of redemption, they avow they pray to their Angel kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and would be glad to pray to all the Saints, if they were perſwaded of their audience, and now many means have they found out of getting intelligence to the Saints of mens eſtate on earth, eſpecially that glaſſe of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. As for merit they goe as farre in it as <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> their Epigrams are famous both to Papiſts and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, <hi>Virtutum ſancta &amp; ſpecioſa caterva ſalutem, divine ex pacto quam meruere dabunt.</hi> The laſt ſcruple which might appeare in theſe prayers is a ſupplication for caſe to all who have dyed in faith and ſleep in peace; from this all the Papiſts deduce Purgatorie, yet this paſſage is defended by our men; as for Purgatorie they are very neere it, <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> they teach openly, yea Chriſts deſcent there, and lower alſo, for the bringing up of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, Plato, Socrates, Theſeus, Penelope,</hi> and many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. The grounds of Scripture whereby we refute Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie they deny, the paſſages of Scriptures and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie whereby the Papiſts labour to prove Purgatorie, they preſſe on us, an expiative Purgatorie wherein by the prayers of the living the ſinnes of the dead are put away they profeſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, After the Canon followes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for better preparation thereto, the <hi>Miſſall</hi> hath ſome more prayers and ceremonies; the firſt prayer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Canon, is the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> with the Preface <hi>aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus dicere,</hi> the Prieſt having once gotten Chriſt the Son in his hands after the muttering of the prayers of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration and oblation, is bold with a loud voice to ſay,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:156872:54"/> Our Father: It is ſo in our Books clearly. After the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſter</hi> are ſundry ſhort prayers, the ſumme whereof is in our prayer of humble acceſſe; as for the ceremonies of breaking the hoſt in three parts, the giving the pax, and ſo forth, our men will never ſtrain at ſuch gnattes, they maintaine the Churches power of inſtituting ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant rites, they take in worſe ceremonies than thoſe, to wit, ſurplices, rotchets, copes, candles, incenſe, organs, cornets, chancells, altars, rails, vails, a reclinatorie for confeſſion, a lavatorie, a repoſitorie, alſo croſſings, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, bowings, duckings, and which is worſt of all, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes of maſſie ſilver, images in carved ſtone and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the knee before them.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, Before the communion we have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that the Preacher ſhall communicate firſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone in both kinds, this is the Roman order, where the Prieſts communion in both kinds is onely required, the peoples communion they count but accidentall, this is the conſumption wherein they put the chiefe part of the eſſence of the Maſſe, we direct the people to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in their own order, never a word of both kinds, yea we ſeeme to make the giving of the cup to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple no wayes neceſſary, for our men build the peoples right to the cup not on Gods word, but onely on traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they approve diverſe caſes of old, where the people did participate the bread alone, they have repoſitories neere the Altar for keeping of the conſecrated bread to the uſe of the ſick. In the diſtribution, the words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Prieſt aſſures the receiver that he takes in his mouth the body of Chriſt, are put directly in our Booke from the Roman order, the body of Chriſt preſerve thee to life eternall, and to perſwade the receiver the more, he is to ſay Amen unto it. At the receiving of the cup the ſame words are borrowed from the <hi>Miſſall,</hi> the blood of the Lord Jeſus preſerve thy Soule, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon receiver muſt ſay his Amen. The golden ſentences of the Engliſh which here were put in as antidotes to the venome of tranſubſtantiation are expurged and for them
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:156872:55"/> a Rubrick full of blacke venome is put in of covering the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in and challice with a corporall.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, The poſt communion is prayers of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng which the Prieſt ſings in the end of the Service, the ſame in ſubſtance with our collect of thankeſgiving: nothing in any of theſe poſtcommunions which our men doe refuſe; hardly will you finde one ſentence in the Maſſe, from the beginning to the end which our Book-men will not defend as tolerable, and ſo what we want of the full Maſſe, it needs no more but halfe an houres writing to the Biſhops Chaplaine, that in the next Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it may be put in for our full union in our ſervice with the mother Church of Rome. That the intention of our prime Biſhops is Popery in groſſe, it may be ſhewen by reaſons which they will not anſwer in haſte.</p>
            <p>For ſhortneſſe, I will point onely at foure other particulars, to ſhew what ſeeds of Popiſh impietie, idolatry, errour, hereſie, may be ſeene in our Booke; for impietie, they put the Sabbath day and other feſtivals of humane inſtitution all in one order, teaching that the fourth command of God is not the ground of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes obſervation, that we may lawfully without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God doe all theſe things on the Sabbath which may be done on other holy dayes, that is, goe to publick paſtimes, reap corne, fiſh, take journey on horſe or foot. Secondly, for idolatry, the croſſe in baptiſme will lead to it, for they avow from the uſe of the ſigne of the croſſe in Baptiſme, doth follow clearly the lawfulneſſe of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall croſſes, crucifixes, images of all kinds in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for religious uſe, yea that the religious uſe of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges moves the heart with many pious affections, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with a deepe reverence towards the perſon who by the image is repreſented, which reverence is lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by outward adoration before the Image. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for groſſe errour, the Book tells that all baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have all things neceſſary to ſalvation, and all of them who dye before the yeares of diſcretion are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſaved, from hence our men conclude that all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:156872:55"/> the Articles of <hi>Arminius</hi> doe clearly follow the totall and finall apoſtaſie of millions from the ſtate of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ſalvation, the power of mans free-will to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, reſiſt, overcome and reject efficacious regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſaving grace, the perſeverance in grace by our free-will antecedent in Gods mind to his decree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the intention of Chriſt to ſanctifie and ſave aſwell the reprobate as the elect, the conferring of ſufficient grace to reprobates, yea univerſally to all men, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the avowed doctrines from the ſame ground of our men without circumloquution, yea from another place may be gathered the errour of juſtification by the works of the Law, which all Proteſtants ever deteſted as a damnable hereſie, the Book requires the reſtitution of the ancient penance, that by the afflictions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the ſoule may be ſaved, then bodily penance ſatisfies Gods wrath for ſinne;<note place="margin">See the Self-conviction.</note> ſo faith in the blood of Chriſt is not our ſole juſtification; the Papiſts goe no farther in this point in their injurious hereſie of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than our men theſe yeares paſt have gone, and that without controlment, except advancement to high honour and great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices be counted a puniſhment.</p>
